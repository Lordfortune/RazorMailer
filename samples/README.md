##A Sample Application for RazorMailer##
This sample application demonstrating how easy it is to send out emails using RazorMailer.  The email templates and logic is stored in a separate assembly, ``Sample.Core``, tested in another class ``Sample.Core.Tests`` using xUnit and actually sent from an MVC 5 app, ``Sample.Web``.

The above setup is entirely flexible and allows you to send emails from web applications (MVC, NancyFX etc), console apps, services or a mixture of each.
